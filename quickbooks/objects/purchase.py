    QBO definition: This entity represents expenses, such as a purchase made from a vendor.
    There are three types of Purchases: Cash, Check, and Credit Card.

     - Cash Purchase contains information regarding a payment made in cash.
     - Check Purchase contains information regarding a payment made by check.
     - Credit Card Purchase contains information regarding a payment made by credit card or refunded/credited back
       to a credit card.

    For example, to create a transaction that sends a check to a vendor, create a Purchase object with PaymentType
    set to Check. To query Purchase transactions of a certain type, for example Check, submit the following to the
    query endpoint: SELECT * from Purchase where PaymentType='Check' You must specify an AccountRef for all purchases.
    The TotalAmtattribute must add up to sum of Line.Amount attributes.
