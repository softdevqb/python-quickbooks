    QBO definition: Account is a component of a Chart Of Accounts, and is part of a Ledger. Used to record a total
    monetary amount allocated against a specific use. Accounts are one of five basic types: asset, liability,
    revenue (income), expenses, or equity. Delete is achieved by setting the Active attribute to false in an entity
    update request; thus, making it inactive. In this type of delete, the record is not permanently deleted, but
    is hidden for display purposes. References to inactive objects are left intact.
