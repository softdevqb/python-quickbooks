This builds on the work of simonv3. I'm adding some functionality to handle additional accounting functions,
beginning with a programmatic export of a chart of accounts and a facility for generating ledger lines from transaction business objects (e.g. Bill, JournalEntry, Purchase).

I'm new to github, eager to build some cool things here, and welcome your constructive feedback on how to
improve my coding, collaboration, and knowledge base.
